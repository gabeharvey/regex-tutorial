# Hexadecimal Value Regular Expression

This Regular Expression (Regex) Tutorial will focus on the use of Hexadecimal Values (Hex Values). Each section will explain in detail a specific aspect of Hex Value Regex and how it functions within the expression. Please refer to the Table of Contents to search for a particular segment.

## Summary

The following code snippet will be analyzed and explained in detail in this tutorial:

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

The sections explored will include Anchors, Quantifiers, OR Operator, Character Classes, Flags, Grouping and Capturing, Bracket Expressions, Greedy and Lazy Match, Boundaries, Back-references, and Look-ahead and Look-behind.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

`^` and `$` meta characters are considered anchors in Hex Value Regex. `^` notates the beginning of the string being analyzed and `$` notates the end of the string. All of the code snippet that lies between the anchors `^` and `$` is what Regex will be searching for. No additional characters that lie outside of the anchors will be considered part of the Hex Value Regex pattern.

### Quantifiers

There are several quantifiers in our code snippet. The first quantifier `#` is considered optional due to following `?` character. Here are two case examples demonstrating how `#` is optional in the string:

`#123456` matches the regex pattern because it includes `#` and is followed by 6 hexadecimal characters.

`123456` also matches the regex pattern even though it does not include a `#` because it includes 6 hexadecimal characters.

Here are two quantifiers that must be taken into consideration in the pattern:

`{6}` indicates that the expression must include 6 hexadecimal characters.

`{3}` indicates that the expression must include 3 hexadecimal characters.
